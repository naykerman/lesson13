                     <span>Geralt of Rivia</span> was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout
                     the 13th
                     century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous
                     relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited
                     unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was
                     subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him
                     greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.Despite his title, Geralt did not
                     hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up
                     in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy
                     to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master
                     Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice
                     was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen
                     name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian
                     accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the
                     Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused
                     him. He, therefore, became a true knight.

                     <span>Yennefer of Vengerberg</span>, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in
                     Vengerberg, the
                     capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she
                     viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep
                     her from harm.
                     She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend
                     of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood of
                     Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see
                     eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

                     <span>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon</span> (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253, and most
                     likely
                     during the Belleteyn holiday. She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and
                     Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's
                     granddaughter.
                     After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and
                     Geralt invoked the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to
                     Duny.

                     <span>Vesemir</span> was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century
                     and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he
                     spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.
                     He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By
                     the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he
                     didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples
                     into witchers.
